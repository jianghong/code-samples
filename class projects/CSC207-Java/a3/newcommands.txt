Following the current design of your system, you would create a pushd and popd class that implements Command.

Create a stack class for directories that has your typical stack functionality. 

For pushd:
First get the current directory and push that onto the stack.
You already have a method that searches through the current directory for the name of a directory, so you can use that to find the directory you wish to pushd.
The method should error check to see if the directory exists in the first place.
Push the directory found onto your stack, then set the current working directory to that directory.

For popd:
If the stack is nonempty, pop out a directory using the stack's pop.
Then, using stack's top command, set the current working directory to the top of that stack.
Of course, you need to continuously check if the stack is nonempty before popping, and if there are no more after popping, make sure the directory is not changed.
