- is used for cons.
# is used for neutral points that are either questions or personal preference.

=====
summary
=====
+Overall, very clean style. 
+I found it easy to read.
+Your design choices are simple and intuitive, there is little clutter
-Minor grammatical errors here and there.
-javadocs could be more clear in some areas
-Missing javadocs for some methods
=====
javadoc
=====
-This applies throughout the javadocs: "paths can be relative or absolute" can be made more clear on the meaning.
-Line 6 has a small grammatical error. No need for the word "can".
-Line 9-10 is confusing to me. Reword it or clarify.
-missing javadoc for getPathArray.
-whiteSpaceTokenizer javadoc can be more specific. Mention something about dealing with white space, since that is the method's name.
-There is a typo on line 80. "give" should be "given"
-Line 130 could use a comment or two explaining that block. 
-Complete javadoc missing for methods from line 100 and onwards. 

=====
style
=====
+Good formatting.
-Line 57, has an Arraylist<Path> named pathArray. You also have another private variable with the same name at line 16. This could be confusing.

=====
design
=====
+Good helper methods
#Interesting choice of using StringTokenizer instead of string split. I can see how it helps for your implementation.
-However, this design choice is probably less common (I personally had to look up how it worked), so could be confusing to a reader.
